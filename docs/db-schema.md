# Database Schema: landscape

This cheat sheet lists live tables, columns, and foreign keys from the `landscape` schema.

Regenerate after schema changes:

- Run with env var set: `DATABASE_URL=postgres://... npm run schema:md`
- Output file: `docs/db-schema.md`

Note: This file is generated from live introspection and should be committed alongside application changes that depend on schema updates.

_(Initial placeholder; run the script to populate with your live schema.)_
